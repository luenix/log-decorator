# log-decorator
Python (3.8 targeted) logging handled by way of decorators + built-ins.

To-dos:
* Research 3.8 through 3.10 features as they pertain to decorators and unittest.mock ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html))
* Add unittest-based tests here
